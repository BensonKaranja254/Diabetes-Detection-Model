# Diabetes Detection Model

## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the onset of diabetes based on various health indicators. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about patients, including their age, gender, glucose level, blood pressure, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset . This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of patient information and diabetes diagnosis.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on Random Forest Classifier. This architecture has been chosen for its effectiveness in handling complex patterns and its ability to generalize well to unseen data.
